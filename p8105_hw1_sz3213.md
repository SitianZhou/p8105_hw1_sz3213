``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

The dataset `early_january_weather` consists of 358 rows and 15
variables. This dataset includes various essential variables measured at
EWR weather station from January 1st to January 15th in 2013: `temp` and
`dewp` for temperature and dew point, `humid` for the relative humidity,
`wind_dir`, `wind_speed`, `wind_gust` for wind direction, speed and gust
speed, respectively. Additionally, `precip`, `pressure`, and `visib`
represent precipitation, sea level pressure, and visibility. The mean
temperature in Fahrenheit is 39.5821229.

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid))
```

``` r
#ggsave("scatterplot_weather.pdf")
```

The scatter plot shows a weak positive correlation between temperature
and date in January. The daily temperature fluctuation tends to be
smaller when humidity is high (Jan 13-Jan 14) compared to the rest of
the day when humidity is around 50.
